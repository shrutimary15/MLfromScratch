# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python, NumPy, and other core libraries. The goal of this project is to provide clear and educational implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms without relying on higher-level libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Algorithms Included
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented in this repository:

1. Linear Regression

2. Logistic Regression

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

4. Decision Tree

5. Random Forest

6. PCA(Principal Component Analysis)

7. Perceptron

8. SVM



## Requirements
To run these implementations, you need Python and the following libraries installed:

NumPy
Matplotlib (for data visualization in some implementations)
You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file with example code that demonstrates how to use it. You can find usage examples and detailed explanations in each algorithm's file.

To run an algorithm, simply execute the Python file associated with that algorithm. For example, to run the Linear Regression implementation, use:

```
python linear_regression.py
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new machine learning algorithms, improve existing implementations, or provide more detailed explanations, please feel free to create a pull request. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows the coding style of the project.

## Acknowledgments
This project draws inspiration from various machine learning courses and textbooks, as well as open-source projects and educational resources available online. It aims to make machine learning algorithms more accessible and understandable to a broader audience.
